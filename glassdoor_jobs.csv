Senior Software Development Engineer,"Amazon product search, one of the most heavily used services in the world, indexes billions of products and serves hundreds of millions of customers world-wide daily. We are working on a new initiative to transform our search engine into a shopping engine that assists customers with their shopping missions. Were looking at every aspect of search, from query understanding to front-end UX, ranking and relevance, indexing and tiering and asking how we can make big step improvements by applying advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. This is a rare opportunity to develop cutting edge ML solutions and apply them to a search problem of this magnitude. Some exciting questions that we expect to answer over the next few years include:

- Can we deeply understand customer intent and personalize their search experience even when they type broad queries such as dress or espresso machine?
- Can we reduce the cost of serving customer queries on Amazon by orders of magnitude using ML to predict n-grams and tuples that many queries decompose into, apply expensive ranking functions offline to identify the most relevant products that match these terms, and index these for efficient online retrieval? We expect this to lead to exciting research at the intersection of systems and ML.
- Can we deeply understand the catalog to surface products that offer the most value to a customer? The challenge here is that the definition of value is subjective and personal, and therefore requires a deeper understanding of the customers intent as well as preferences.
- Can we use deep learning to transfer behavioral signals from frequently purchased products in the head to products in the tail where behavioral signals are sparse? The challenge here is the scale, and the fact that the head and torso contain only a small fraction of products while the tail contains an overwhelmingly large fraction of the products in the catalog.
- We have hired ML experts from leading research labs and academia to spearhead this effort. Our research leaders include Trishul Chilimbi (formerly MSR), Inderjit Dhillon (UT Austin), Guy Lebanon (formerly Georgia Tech), and S.V.N. (Vishy) Vishwanathan (formerly UC Santa Cruz). We are looking to hire Software Development Engineers (SDEs) and ML Applied Scientists at all levels, with experience in Search, Personalization, NLP, Systems, ML, DL and UI Design. Internship opportunities are also available throughout the year and we are flexible with duration and start dates. You will be working alongside world-class scientists and engineers to build next generation search systems and will be able to deploy your ML models into production. Our team is proud of its collaborative and open research environment, where long term thinking and risk taking are highly rewarded. We value academic collaborations and encourage our scientists and engineers to participate and publish in top conferences such as NIPS, ICML, KDD, SIGIR and WWW. Positions are available in Palo Alto, Berkeley, Seattle, Boston, Barcelona, and Tokyo.

The Query Understanding infrastructure team is building the next generation DL (deep learning) online inferencing system that is the key for applying state of the art DL models to product search. The online inferencing system puts challenges in many ways. How to build efficient systems across heterogenous hardware architecture involving CPUs and GPUs? How to build optimized services that serves billions of requests daily with load latency and high resiliency? How to architect the system that it can support use cases from different teams of Amazon, including search, Ads, and Alexa? How to build automated infrastructure to leverage the transfer learning capability of the DL models for new marketplaces?

As an engineer on the team, you will define, design and implement key initiatives in building the new DL systems that powers search, sponsored products, Alexa and many other downstream applications; work closely with other applied scientists, engineers, engineering and product managers to drive new enhancements to the system; design and build machine learning platform that powers deep learning; work with various AWS technologies and distributed computing technologies; build a robust, scalable and an extensible platform which supports large scale data analyses, model development, training, validation and implementation .
You will love this role because you will:
-Work on a world-class Query Understanding service that handles billions of requests per day and is an important component of Amazon Product Search
-Learn state of the art in terms of AWS and NLP/ML technology and figure out creative ways to make these work at production scale.
-Gain exposure to the workings of the largest e-commerce search engine and an opportunity to work with a dynamic team to define and develop innovative solutions that will have a direct impact on Amazon product search.
-Work with large data sets to analyze and improve the search experience using various AWS technologies.
- Have access to Amazon's vast technical resources to get the job done.
At Amazon Search, youll experience the benefits of working in a dynamic, entrepreneurial environment, while leveraging the resources of Amazon.com (AMZN), one of the world's leading internet companies.

Skills/Competencies:

Communication: Data scientists must communicate effectively up and down the data supply chain: first, to obtain access to the data they require; second, to work with those who understand the business meaning behind the data; and third, to articulate findings and implications to business leaders in language they understand. A data scientist must be able to use data to tell stories. Key components of these communication skills are those of persuasion and expectation management. The ability to insert themselves into core business functions and assert their ideas is therefore critical.

Collaboration: Working directly for business leaders and side-by-side with business unit personnel, they need to shed the introverted statistician stereotype. Increasingly, business professionals require access to analytic techniques beyond basic math and must be able to rely on the data scientist to work closely with them. The data scientist enables the broad consumerization of derivative result sets and analytics (if not the raw data). The data scientist must have the ability to juggle competing priorities and pressures.

Leadership. The role of the data scientist can incorporate data oversight responsibilities including directing the efforts of teams of consultant statisticians, data administration and integration professionals, and data visualization, reporting, and application integration developers.

Creativity. The work of the data scientist is very much an innovation-oriented exercise in solving open-ended conundrums. Data scientists are tasked with finding opportunities to optimize, expand or transform the business through the lens of information. Moreover, data scientists must be creative in sourcing data, modeling problems and employing a range of analytic techniques.

Discipline. Although creativity is critical, data scientists must remember that ""science"" is part of their directive. This means following established scientific methods, employing legitimate techniques, using valid data and embracing causality. Scientific methods demand that questions are well-defined, true data (observations) is collected, and hypotheses are formed, investigative methods are selected, data is analyzed and interpreted with yielding conclusions, and results are formally communicated and tested. Although rigid methodology is recommended, results perfection is not. Business opportunity costs in a fast-paced marketplace are too high to spend excessive time achieving incrementally better analyses. However, a data scientist just as any good statistician or other analytics professional must understand the differences between correlation and causality and between incidental and insightful patterns.

Passion: An obsession for information, solving insurmountable problems and finding unique ways to accelerate the business.

Consultancy: Manages provision of specialist knowledge over a range of topics in data science including the role of IT in the business; in own areas of expertise provides advice and guidance influencing the effectiveness of the organizations business processes.

Data Design: Controls analytics data design practice within the enterprise. Influences industry-based models for the development of new technology applications. Develops effective implementation and procurement strategies, consistent with business needs.

Data Analysis: Sets standards for advanced analytics tool usage and techniques, advises on their application, and ensures compliance. Manages the investigation of corporate data requirements, and co-ordinates the application of data analysis and analytics techniques, based upon a detailed understanding of the corporate information requirements, in order to establish, modify or maintain analytical models and their associated components.

Autonomy: Has authority and responsibility for all aspects of data science, including policy formation and application. Is fully accountable for actions taken and decisions made, both by self and subordinates.

Influence: Makes decisions critical to organizational success. Influences developments within the IT industry at the highest levels. Advances the knowledge and/or exploitation of IT within one or more organizations. Develops long-term strategic relationships with customers, partners, industry leaders and government.

Complexity: Performs highly complex work activities covering technical, financial and quality aspects. Contributes to the formulation and implementation of IT strategy. Creatively applies a wide range of technical and/or management principles.

Business Skills Absorbs complex technical information and communicates effectively at all levels to both technical and non-technical audiences. Assesses and evaluates risk. Understands the implications of new technologies. Demonstrates clear leadership and the ability to influence and persuade. Has a broad understanding of all aspects of IT and deep understanding of own specialism(s). Understands and communicates the role and impact of IT in the employing organization and promotes compliance with relevant legislation. Takes the initiative to keep both own and subordinates' skills up to date and to maintain an awareness of developments in the IT industry.

Amazon product search, one of the most heavily used services in the world, indexes billions of products and serves hundreds of millions of customers world-wide daily. We are working on a new initiative to transform our search engine into a shopping engine that assists customers with their shopping missions. We’re looking at every aspect of search, from query understanding to front-end UX, ranking and relevance, indexing and tiering and asking how we can make big step improvements by applying advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. This is a rare opportunity to develop cutting edge ML solutions and apply them to a search problem of this magnitude. Some exciting questions that we expect to answer over the next few years include:
Can we deeply understand customer intent and personalize their search experience even when they type broad queries such as “dress” or “espresso machine”?
Can we reduce the cost of serving customer queries on Amazon by orders of magnitude using ML to predict n-grams and tuples that many queries decompose into, apply expensive ranking functions offline to identify the most relevant products that match these terms, and index these for efficient online retrieval? We expect this to lead to exciting research at the intersection of systems and ML.
Can we deeply understand the catalog to surface products that offer the most value to a customer? The challenge here is that the definition of value is subjective and personal, and therefore requires a deeper understanding of the customers intent as well as preferences.
Can we use deep learning to transfer behavioral signals from frequently purchased products in the head to products in the tail where behavioral signals are sparse? The challenge here is the scale, and the fact that the head and torso contain only a small fraction of products while the tail contains an overwhelmingly large fraction of the products in the catalog.
We have hired ML experts from leading research labs and academia to spearhead this effort. Our research leaders include Trishul Chilimbi (formerly MSR), Inderjit Dhillon (UT Austin), Guy Lebanon (formerly Georgia Tech), and S.V.N. (Vishy) Vishwanathan (formerly UC Santa Cruz). We are looking to hire Software Development Engineers (SDEs) and ML Applied Scientists at all levels, with experience in Search, Personalization, NLP, Systems, ML, DL and UI Design. Internship opportunities are also available throughout the year and we are flexible with duration and start dates. You will be working alongside world-class scientists and engineers to build next generation search systems and will be able to deploy your ML models into production. Our team is proud of its collaborative and open research environment, where long term thinking and risk taking are highly rewarded. We value academic collaborations and encourage our scientists and engineers to participate and publish in top conferences such as NIPS, ICML, KDD, SIGIR and WWW. Positions are available in Palo Alto, Berkeley, Seattle, Boston, Barcelona, and Tokyo.
The Query Understanding infrastructure team is building the next generation DL (deep learning) online inferencing system that is the key for applying state of the art DL models to product search. The online inferencing system puts challenges in many ways. How to build efficient systems across heterogenous hardware architecture involving CPUs and GPUs? How to build optimized services that serves billions of requests daily with load latency and high resiliency? How to architect the system that it can support use cases from different teams of Amazon, including search, Ads, and Alexa? How to build automated infrastructure to leverage the transfer learning capability of the DL models for new marketplaces?

As an engineer on the team, you will define, design and implement key initiatives in building the new DL systems that powers search, sponsored products, Alexa and many other downstream applications; work closely with other applied scientists, engineers, engineering and product managers to drive new enhancements to the system; design and build machine learning platform that powers deep learning; work with various AWS technologies and distributed computing technologies; build a robust, scalable and an extensible platform which supports large scale data analyses, model development, training, validation and implementation .

You will love this role because you will:
